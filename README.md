# Alien-Attackers
A Space Invaders parody game created in Turing for my ICS3U1 culminating project. 

This uses Turing graphics for the GUI, and was the first project I have ever finished. 
All sprites were made in Paint3D by myself.
Everything including the behaviour of the aliens were implemented in Turing.
